# Magento security due to PCI DSS

This project contains the presentation I used during the Magento Meetup held by [Push On](http://www.pushon.co.uk/) at [Mad Lab](https://madlab.org.uk) in Manchester the 26th of July 2017. The topic is a general introduction to the infosec related core concepts behind the PCI DSS, what the PCI DSS means and how us Magento developers can write good and secure code, maintain secure production environments and some other points we should keep attention during a Magento project.

The content of this project wants to represent an indication of concepts and resources that can be studied in depth with from online references.

Feel free to report any error or amend the project.
